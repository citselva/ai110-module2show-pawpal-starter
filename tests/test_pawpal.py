        """KNOWN LIMITATION: detect_conflicts() cannot identify overlaps that cross
        midnight because start_time values are sorted lexicographically.

        Scenario:
            late_task  starts at 23:50, runs 30 min → ends at 00:20 (next day)
            early_task starts at 00:05

        Expected correct behavior: conflict detected (00:05 falls inside 23:50–00:20).
        Actual behavior:           no conflict detected.

        Root cause: lexicographic sort places '00:05' before '23:50', so the
        sweep-line evaluates ('00:05' task as prev, '23:50' task as curr) and
        checks '23:50' < '00:15' → False → no conflict reported.

        This test asserts the CURRENT (broken) behavior so that:
          1. The blind spot is visible in CI output.
          2. Any future fix that makes this test pass will be caught immediately.
